                    <h3>What is Interactive Legend?</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The ArcGIS Online Interactive Layer is an Instant App template that offers an intuitive experience, enabling users to configure and toggle layers for their specific spatial analysis requirements. The interface mirrors the version found on ArcGIS Pro, but the features are more streamlined. Interactive Legend has an option to add a short description before the web map loads, providing users with a understanding of the data being used.</p>
                    <h3>Comparison</h3>
                    <hr>
                    <p>The Interactive Legend template and StoryMaps serve distinct purposes, each offering unique features tailored to different requirements. <br><br>The Interactive Legend is designed for quick and efficient spatial analysis, allowing users to configure layers and toggle settings for their analysis requirements. With limited description and summary options, this template appears to be more suited to new users who are familiar with the data used. For example, a web map for office internal usage. <br><br>On the other hand, StoryMaps places emphasis on the narration of maps, blending maps with storytelling. Users can integrate multimedia elements, text, and interactive elements, aligning with the purpose and presentation of the maps.
